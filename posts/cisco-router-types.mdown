## Terms

### Fixed configuration routers ###

- Pre determined fixed LAN and WAN interface options.
- i.e. interfaces limited to factory installed (cannot be changed).
- If interface has errors must replace whole router.
- e.g. 2500 Series and below

### Modular routers                                  

- Built with 1 or more slots that allow customisation.
- Slot numbering left to right.
- Interface type displayed in the top left of the module
- e.g. 2E-2W (2 Ethernet, 2 WIC)
- e.g. 3600 Series

### Cisco WAN Interface Cards (WICs)               

#### Asynchronous serial                        

- Used with modem.
- Supports asynchronous dialup connections.

#### Synchronous serial

- Supports connections such as leased lines, frame relay and X.25

#### BRI

#### Channelized T1 / E1

- Supports leased lines, dial up, ISDN PRI and frame relay.

### Site Classification

#### Central Site

- aka headquarters
- Regional offices and telecommuters connect into for data.
- Requires many different types of WAN connections from remote locations.
- Considerations: multiple connections, access control, QoS, redundancy, scalability
- Cisco routers: Cisco 3600, 4000, AS5x00, 7000

#### Remote Site

- aka remote office / branch office (ROBOs)
- Smaller office located away from central site with smaller size WAN connection.
- Considerations: multiple connections, access control, redundancy, authentication, availability
- Cisco routers: Cisco 1600, 1700, 2500, 2600

#### Telecommuters

- aka Small Office / Home Office (SOHO)
- Small office with 1 to few employees (tend to use dialup services).
- Also mobile users (asynchronous dialup connections through carrier).
- Considerations: availability, authentication
- Cisco routers: Cisco 700 (760 or 770), 800, 1000

### Switch Site Classification

#### Access Layer 

- Workgroup / user access to network (merge into distribution devices).
- Low cost, high port densities.
- Catalyst 19xx, 2820, 29xx

#### Distribution Layer

- Layer 2, 3 functionality (either switch and router or multi layer switch).
- Defines broadcast boundaries (i.e. VLANs donâ€™t extend beyond distribution switch).
- Policy based connectivity (security, address aggregation, inter VLAN routing etc).
- Catalyst 55xx, 6500

#### Core Layer

- Switch traffic as fast as possible (either frame, packet, cell technologies).
- No layer 3, used >= 2 or more switch blocks.
- Should not perform any packet manipulation (e.g. access lists, filtering).
- Because VLANs terminate at distribution device, core links are not trunk links and traffic is routed across the core.
- Catalyst 55xx, 65xx, 85xx
- 2 basic core designs:
  - Collapsed Core
      - Distributing / core layer functions on the same device.
      - Each access device 1 redundant link to the distribution layer switch.
      - All subnets terminate at layer 3 ports on the distribution switch.
      - Redundancy provided at layer 3 by HSRP.
  - Dual Core
      - Used >2 switch blocks and redundant connections required.
      - Core devices not linked to each other to avoid switching loops.
      - Provides 2 equal cost paths to each distribution switch.
      - Therefore twice the bandwidth.
      - Routing protocol used on layer 3 device determines the number of distribution devices that can be attached to the core.
